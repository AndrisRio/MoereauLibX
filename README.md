# MoereauLibX
An update of my old Spotify Theme, Moereau, for LibraryX

WIP

# !
ONLY FOR SPOTIFY WITH LIBRARY X UI (Version 1.2.9 or later) and Spicetify (v2.17.2 or later)

// I always block Spotify built-in updater so I usually skip some version, let me know if this theme somehow broke on newer version
